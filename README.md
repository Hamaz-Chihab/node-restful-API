# Task Manager RESTful API

## Description

The Task Manager RESTful API is a powerful and flexible tool for managing tasks and user accounts in a straightforward and efficient way. It's built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, making it an ideal solution for teams and individuals looking to streamline their task management processes.

### Key Features

- **User Management**: The API allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. It implements token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure data security.

- **Task Management**: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks. Each task is associated with the user who created it, ensuring data isolation.

- **RESTful Design**: The API follows RESTful principles for clean and predictable endpoints, making it easy to integrate with other applications and services.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A fast and scalable JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, simplifying route handling and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing data.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Used for user authentication and authorization.
